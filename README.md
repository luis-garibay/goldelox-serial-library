# goldelox-serial-library
An arduino interface library for the GOLDELOX processor

# Purpose
A few years ago I wanted to make an arduino wearable with a ÂµOLED-96-G2 display, but couldn't find a working library to interface with the device.
So, I wrote my own functions based on the GOLDELOX processor's serial commands.
Then I decided to make those functions into a library.

I intend to make the code more memory efficient (you can only pack so much code into an arduino pro mini) and as simple to use as possible.
I also want to write some decent documentation for the library.
